	/**
	 * The HTTP interface is the central class implementing the asebahttp switch. It manages three kinds of Dashel streams:
	 *  - httpStream: a listening server socket waiting for incoming HTTP connections
	 *  - httpConnections: incoming HTTP client connections making requests to the interface
	 *  - targets: connected Dashel targets to this Aseba network hub, where messages are switched between
	 *
	 * The interface is able to handle disconnections and reconnections of both HTTP client connections and Dashel targets.
	 *
	 * On the HTTP side, it reacts to several kinds of requests provided by HTTP handlers registered with the interface.
	 * There are broadly three different ways of handling a request:
	 *  - immediate response: if the request can be answered as it arrives, it will be
	 *  - delayed response: some requests require sending and receiving messages on the aseba bus. In this case, the
	 *    originating HTTP request is stalled until it can be answered
	 *  - event streams: HTTP requests can subscribe to event streams, in which case they will block the Dashel stream for
	 *    other requests, but will instead be provided a live feed of incoming events on the Aseba bus
	 *
	 * On the Dashel side, node ids are automatically remapped if a collision occurs between several targets to make them
	 * unique. Further, the interface reacts to several kinds of messages observed on the Aseba bus:
	 *  - node descriptions: are parsed and added to a list of nodes for each Dashel target
	 *  - variables: are reacted to if there were incoming HTTP requests for variables
	 *  - user messages: are reacted to if there were incoming HTTP requests for events
	 *  - error messages: are reacted to if there were incoming HTTP requests for execution events (divison by zero, etc.)
	 *
	 * The HTTP interface is also able to distribute an AESL program received over HTTP to its network. In that case, it
	 * is assumed that all nodes share the AESL file and different code entries are provided for the different nodes to
	 * be programmed.
