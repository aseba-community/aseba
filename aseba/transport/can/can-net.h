/**
	\defgroup can Transport layer over CAN bus

	This layer is able to transmit messages of arbitrary length
	(up to the available amount of memory) over a serie of 8 bytes
	CAN frames. If the message is under 8 bytes, the layer uses
	a single frame.

	The layer does not uses acknowledgment, instead it trusts the
	CAN checksum mechanism to ensure that other nodes on the CAN bus
	received the data correctly.

	This transport layer only works on little-endian systems for now,
	as it does not perform endian correction.
