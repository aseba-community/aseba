	\defgroup transport-buffer Helper for transport layers using buffers

	This helper provides to the VM:
	* AsebaSendMessage()
	* AsebaSendVariables()
	* AsebaSendDescription()

	This helper provides to the glue code:
	* AsebaProcessIncomingEvents()

	This helper requires from the lower level transport layer:
	* AsebaSendBuffer()
	* AsebaGetBuffer()

	This helper requires from the glue code:
	* AsebaGetVMDescription()
	* AsebaGetNativeFunctionsDescriptions()

	To have a working implementation, the glue code must still implement:
	* AsebaNativeFunction()
	* AsebaAssert(), if ASEBA_ASSERT is defined
