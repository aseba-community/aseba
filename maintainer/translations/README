In this directory, you will find a bunch of scripts to maintain the translation
files. When you want to add a new language, it is necessary to generate several
files, and update others as well. The script "01_new_language.py" will help
you in this task. Just run it, and answer to the questions. At the end, just
perform a "git commit" to commit the newly created / updated files.


For regular updates, use the following scripts:

  |-> - 02_sync_compiler_translation.py
  |         Takes the error codes from the compiler, and generates the
  |         corresponding C++ source file in Aseba Studio.
  |
  |   - 03_sync_all_translations.py
  |         Takes all the existing .ts, then performs lupate / lrelease
  |
  |-- - 04_translation_statistics.py
            Gives some statistics about the current translations
